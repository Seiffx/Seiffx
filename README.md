# 🛡️ Seif Awaad – Cybersecurity Projects & Offensive Research

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio — a collection of hands-on cybersecurity projects, red/blue team simulations, reverse engineering analysis, and secure infrastructure work. I combine practical research with industry-aligned execution, working across operating systems, embedded systems, and smart infrastructure.

I’m currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity** at Rochester Institute of Technology – Dubai, with professional experience at Siemens and additional independent research labs.
